# landscape_typ_DCEC
Python code to create automated landscape typologies with Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering.

The code was used to generate the results presented in the manuscript titled "Automated landscape typologies with Deep Convolutional Embedded Clustering" (version 27 Jan 2021).

Parts of the code were adapted from the code belonging to the publication: Guo X, Liu X, Zhu E, Yin J (2017) Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders, Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing, Guangzhou, China.
